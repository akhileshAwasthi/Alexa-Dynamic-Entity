# Alexa-Dynamic-Entity


With the use of dynamic entities, you can augment your skill's predefined static catalogs by allowing your skill to dynamically create new entities in runtime. 
Without dynamic entities, the entities are resolved at build time and remain the same until an update is made to the skill, and you cannot customize entities by customer or by dialog turn. With dynamic entities, you can create personalized voice experiences, and dynamically enable or disable slot values based on conversation or user context. 
The use of dynamic entities boosts speech recognition, natural language understanding, and entity resolution accuracy by dynamically biasing Alexa's models based on the newly-loaded slot values.
